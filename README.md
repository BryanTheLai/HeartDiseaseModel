## Project Summary

### Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset from the UCI ML Repository. It involves data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and deployment.

### Data Understanding
- **Collection**: Fetched Heart Disease dataset from UCI ML Repository.
- **Description**: Renamed columns for readability and checked for null values and data types.
- **Exploration**: Generated distribution plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.

### Data Preparation
- **Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and missing values; handled outliers using Z-scores.
- **Transformation**: Binned numerical columns (`Age`, `RestingBP`, `SerumCholesterol`, `MaxHeartRate`, `OldPeak`) and transformed the target variable to binary.

### Data Splitting
- **Feature Selection**: Chose relevant features: `Gender`, `ChestPainType`, `ExerciseAngina`, `ExerciseSlope`, `MajorVessels`, `ThalliumStress`, binned versions of `MaxHeartRate` and `OldPeak`.
- **Scaling**: Used `StandardScaler`.
- **Split**: Training (80%) and test sets (20%) with a fixed random state.

### Modelling
- **Models**: Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM.
- **Evaluation**: Tested accuracy, cross-validation accuracy; printed classification reports, confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1 scores.

### Deployment
- **User Input Prediction**: Created a function to get user input; scaled input data; made predictions using Logistic Regression; displayed results with probabilities.

## Key Findings

### Model Performance
| Model               | Test Accuracy | Cross-Validation Accuracy |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.831         | 0.861                      |
| Decision Tree       | 0.831         | 0.789                      |
| SVM                | 0.847         | 0.820                      |

## What Could Have Been Done Differently and Improvements

### Additional Steps
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to capture complex relationships.
- **Handling Imbalance**: Use SMOTE or class weighting for imbalanced data.
- **Advanced Outlier Detection**: Use Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM.

### Model Enhancements
- **More Models**: Train Random Forests, GBMs, Neural Networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions using bagging or stacking.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Additional Metrics**: Evaluate on AUC-ROC score.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculate confidence intervals for performance metrics.

### Deployment Enhancements
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface using Flask or Django.
- **Model Interpretability**: Use SHAP values or LIME for explanations.
- **Continuous Learning**: Implement a system for continuous learning from new data.
